## Overview

Welcome to the Company Home Page with Flexbox project, created as part of the Codecademy curriculum for the Full-Stack Engineering path.

This project focuses on building a layout for a company's homepage using flexbox. We were able to choose to build a new home page for an existing company, or to imagine my own dream company. 

I chose to create a company of my own.

## Features

- **Flexbox** : I used flex box to design difference sections of the website.

- **Media Queries** : I chose to use media queries ensuring that the website looks great on all screen sizes.

- **Color Combination** : I used a color combination that I created to ensure a pleasant viewing experience.

- **Font Combination** : I put together font-families that go well together and complement the overall website and are appropriate for the company.
